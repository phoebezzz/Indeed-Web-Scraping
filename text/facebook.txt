Industry wide, we’ve seen Stories as a new sharing/consumption format rise. One of the top priorities for Facebook this year will be leaning into this trend and making sure that Facebook is a Stories first product. With this change means disrupting the existing ecosystem within Facebook; it means shifting people’s sharing behaviors to be more visual and less text-heavy; it means changing the way people consume content from their friends and family and moving away from a News Feed format; it’ll mean learning how to monetize this new format to mitigate expected revenue cannibalization from News Feed, etc. We need a Data Scientist who is capable of tackling all aspects of this problem. As Data Scientist on the team, you’ll be expected to stretch across growth, engagement, and monetization of Stories, and work with data scientists to help the company execute this major shift.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.      As Facebook continues to expand to all corners of the world, having performant apps matters more than ever. The vast majority of our users access Facebook using old devices and unreliable networks, and bad performance leads to less engaged users and a poor user experience. In this role you will be working closely with the team responsible for making sure the Facebook app delivers the best possible performance across iOS, Android and Web platforms. Our team works cross-functionally with product and infrastructure teams across Facebook to improve app start time, scrolling performance as well as reduce crashes and minimize resources consumption. We’re looking for a thought leader in this space to help us frame up and prioritize all the performance investments that we’re making across the company. This position will directly engage with the CTO for the Facebook app and have the opportunity to directly shape our investments and roadmap for the next 3 years. Some key challenges we’re looking to solve in the next year include: How often do users have a “bad experience” while using the apps? How can we quantify this and how does it affect engagement? What sectors of the population are the most sensitive to performance regressions and how should we adapt our strategy as a result? How should we prioritize our efforts across different users and performance metrics to deliver the best possible performing app?

Together, we can help people build stronger communities — we're just getting started.      At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community; the mission of the Sharing Organization at Facebook is to do just that. The Sharing Ecosystem team’s job is to step back, and tackle deep, challenging questions that'll help inform our understanding of sharing on Facebook and the barriers. Questions like: what’s driving the sharing decline on Facebook, how much of this is from competition, from increasing audience concerns, from politicization of Facebook and changes in sentiment and brand; how do we use our understanding of sharing drivers to make accurate, non-linear forecasts; we know women and children are most susceptible to harassment and bullying - how does this impact their propensity to share, how do we detect and mitigate this in the future? This team is unique in that it’s not directly tied to a product team, which provides the team with the space to dive deep into these topics. The ideal candidate is someone who is a deep systems thinker, and is someone who is looking for a role that is more research heavy.

Benefits/perks listed below may vary depending on the nature of your employment with Microsoft and the country where you work.      Empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. That's what inspires us, drives our work and pushes us to challenge the status quo every day. At Microsoft, we also work to empower our employees, so they can achieve more. We believe we should each find meaning in our work and we ensure employees have the freedom and the reach to help make a difference in the world.   Microsoft Research provides a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines, to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.   The Microsoft Research Computational Social Science (CSS) group is widely recognized as a leading center of CSS research, lying at the intersection of computer science, statistics and the social sciences. Our approach is motivated by two longstanding difficulties for traditional social science: first, that simply gathering observational data on human activity (e.g., who says what to whom, with what effect) is extremely difficult at scale and over time; and second, that running   experiments to manipulate the conditions under which these measurements are made (e.g., randomly assigning large sets of interacting people to treatment and control groups) is even more challenging and often impossible.   In the first category, we exploit digital data that is generated by existing platforms (e.g., email, web browsers, Twitter) to generate novel insights into individual and collective human behavior (e.g., virality of online content, causal impact of recommendations, TV show and ad effectiveness). In the second category, we design novel “virtual lab” experiments that allow for larger scale, longer time horizons, and greater complexity and realism than is possible in physical labs (e.g. team problem solving, dynamics of cooperation over many days). In addition to advancing the state of the science, our work also contributes to innovative new products and strategic capabilities at Microsoft.    Responsibilities    Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.    Qualifications    Required Qualifications    Must be currently enrolled in a PhD program in Computer Science or a related STEM field.   Must have at least 1 year of experience designing, building, and analyzing online experiments    Preferred Qualifications    Demonstrated ability to develop original research agendas.   Must be able to collaborate effectively with other researchers and product development teams.   Excellent interpersonal skills, cross-group and cross-culture collaboration.
